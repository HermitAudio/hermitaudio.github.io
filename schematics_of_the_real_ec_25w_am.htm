<p><strong><big>The schematics of the real EC 25W amplifiers</big></strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.osiris.no"><img src="OsirisEye.jpg" alt="Consulting company providing high-quality software " WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="51"></a></p>

<p>is shown below, taken from a service manual, and by full acceptance from Per Abrahamsen
of Electrocompaniet.&nbsp; Again (since you've probably went directly here) - he approved
and even supported the idea of making these schematics public through this site, in order
to cover the history of Electrocompaniet.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Note that the schematic layout is very equal to the original, except for the changes to
the compensation networks. (Look at the emitters on the differential voltage amplification
pairs.)&nbsp; The major changes can be found by looking at the component lists, which
comes here, and which applies for applifiers with serial numbers below 275.&nbsp; The
component list for serial numbers above 275 is covered in an addendum <a href="#Above275">here</a>.
You must then use both lists and crosscheck to get the full picture.</p>

<p>(PS: I know this scanning is lousy - a better one will come up in a while.....)</p>

<p>So - this covers it.&nbsp; No further change was done to these amplifiers.&nbsp; Well,
not quite true - I did some further modifications after I left Electrocompaniet.&nbsp; You
can read about them here - of course also with schematics. <small><small>(Links will
appear later)</small></small></p>

<p>I'm not quite sure how many amplifiers were made, but by mid 77, we had reached serial
no 275, that took 2 years to reach.&nbsp; From then I believe approx. 50 units were
manufactured each month, until approx. 1981-82, when Electrocompaniet introduced the
Ampliwire series which replaced the 25W amplifier.&nbsp; This means there could be some
2000 amplifiers around.&nbsp; Perhaps Per knows more - I'll make sure to ask him the next
time.&nbsp; </p>
