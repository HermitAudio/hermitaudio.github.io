title: Cooling fins
---



<p>These cooling fins may be the best engineered fins ever made for an audio amplifier.

&nbsp; They are the result of a strong interest in thermodynamics I had at the time. The

fins are much thicher at the base than ordinary fins - and is gradually made thinner

outwards.&nbsp; This was done to improve heat transfer throught the fins, to get an even

surface temperature, thus the lowest heat transfer resistance.</p>



<p>The fins were very carefully designed, and every aspect was calculated to give optimal

performance.&nbsp; The compromise - size and weight - was found to be acceptable to the

gained performance.</p>

<p>If you take a closer look at a fin:</p>

<p>Note the zig-zag pattern. This was done to increase the overall surface area of the fin

with 40%, not bad, huh ?</p>



<p>We made a few tenths of these fins, and they performed as intentended.&nbsp; However,

none ever made it into a commercial amplifier.
