<p><strong><big>Protection networks - power supplies and other stuff not so interesting,
but still needed</big></strong>.</p>

<p>You've read the section on how this came about ?&nbsp; If not <a href="OtalaStory.htm#AmplifierBlowUp">go back and do so</a> !&nbsp; Otherwise, take a look
at the worlds first protection network that did not affect the sound AT ALL.&nbsp; Yes -
it is the first one !</p>

<p>The design is very simple, passive sensing of current, and then triggering a relay
which removes the supply voltage from the output stage.&nbsp; As you've probably know, the
EC design uses one power supply for the voltage amplifying stages and one for the power
output, where all the great currents go.&nbsp; This seperation made this protection scheme
work.&nbsp; If not, big bangs would be heard .....</p>

<p>The power supply also needed some care.</p>

<p>However, we did not make it difficult.&nbsp; The major issue here were the use of small
capacitors instead of the sluggy big ones used by everybody else at that time.&nbsp; We
did understand that small capacitors in parallell were a better choice than sole big ones.

<p>The cabling were another issue, look here later.</p>
