<p>The Regulated 25 W Power Amplifier</p>

<p>We noted early that the power supply had a significant effect on the sound.&nbsp; We
decided to implement regulated power supplies for the amplifier.&nbsp; I'm not quite sure
about when we did this, but it might have been sometime in 76, possible 77.&nbsp; We did
it straightforward, no switching, no nonsense, only linear regulators.&nbsp; Hot ? &nbsp;
Yes, indeed !!!</p>

<p>I've had some trouble locating the schematics for the regulators, but I believe I've
found them.&nbsp; It might be that the ones shown here are prelimenary schematics, but the
design never made it into production, so I'm not quite sure if there ever existed any
other.</p>

<p>There were only made a couple of these amplifiers, and one of these was returned to me
for service a couple of years ago.&nbsp; Sadly, it was now beyond repair :-(</p>

<p>The amplifier have two set of supplies, one for the prestages, and one for the output
stages, so two sets of regulators was needed..</p>

<p>Note the Q27 emitter, it should be coupled to the unregulated prestage power supply.
&nbsp; Q27 acts as a current generator and needs some voltage space.&nbsp; Note also that
there are no current limiters, so if the regulated output was shorted to gnd, blue smoke
was the result !</p>

<p>The transistors are listed with only numbers. 139/140/203/204 are BD, and 413 are BC.</p>

<p>All BD transistors was heatsinked.&nbsp; In fact, they were mounted onto the bottom
plate of the amplifier !</p>
