<h1>The People Involved</h1>

<p>Several people were involved in the development of the 25 W amplifier. This chapter
take the history seen from the perspective of the people involved, in chronological order.</p>

<p>A Finnish Professor named <strong><a href="http://www.tut.fi/~strategy/otala/">Matti Otala</a>
(also <a href="http://www.otala.com">here</a>)</strong>. On sabbatical at Phillips in
Eindhoven. Together with <strong>Jan Lohstroh</strong> they designed a TIM-free amplifier.&nbsp; It was one step in Otala's quest
against the new distortion called TIM, and
later DIM.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Svein Erik Børja</strong>, a Norwegian broadcast and record&nbsp; producer
heard the presentation given by Dr Matti Otala at an AES conference in Copenhagen 1973.
&nbsp; Together with <strong>Nils Jørgen Kjærnet</strong> at Nera he built two units
based on Otala/Lohstroh schematics.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Per Abrahamsen</strong> was contacted by Svein Erik, who knew him from his Mojo
Blues times, and also knew that Per had an audio/electronics company.&nbsp; Mostly Per was
working with PA equipment, but the coming of the Otala amp turned his company
Electrocompaniet into an audio company.</p>

<p>At this time several others were involved with the company, but I don't remember all of
them, mostly because they were before my time, and also because they slowly disappeared as
the company changed from a PA company to a an audio company. Among these were <strong>Petter
Hjerpseth</strong> and <strong>Klaus Væthe Jr.&nbsp;</strong> The latter later became a
good friend of mine, and we did try to make an audio company together in 1983, with the
help of <b>Paal Rasmussen</b>, my former partner at <a href="norsk_radiofabrikk.htm">NRF,</a>&nbsp;
- more later. Petter disappeared during 1975, Klaus stuck with
the company to and from until sometime in 1977/78. </p>

<p>I (<strong>Terje Sandstrøm</strong>) turned up in first late 1974, and started to
visit EC at a monthly basis.&nbsp; After half a year of this Per told me we were both
better off if I started to work for him, instead of just spending his time. In the
beginning I mostly did assembly work, but during 1975 I had worked myself up the ladder,
and later I did more and more of the theoretical work on the amplifier, calculations and
so forth. I stayed until 1979, but did some consulting for EC until 1982.</p>

<p>It is important to note that Svein Erik stayed with the company as its Golden Ear for a
very long time. In a way this was his hobby !</p>

<p><strong>Peik Borud</strong> entered the company in 1976. He was a civil engineer in
electronics, and an audio freak.&nbsp; He stayed throughout 1978, and was together with
Per and me the basic designers of the 25W amplifier in this period. Peik did A LOT during
his time at EC. </p>

<p><strong>Paal Rasmussen</strong> entered the company in 1977 and stayed for slightly
less than a year. &nbsp; He came from Seas AS, a loudspeaker company, and before that he
had worked in England with several of the famous designers there.&nbsp; He later became a
close friend, and we were two out of the three who started The Norwegian Radio
Manufacturing company in 1979, more on this later.</p>

<p><strong>Kjell Winther</strong> was our record provider, and got amplifiers in
return.&nbsp; He was also a hi-fi nut, working in a record store, and provided us with the
latest and best sounding records for our sound tests.</p>

<p><strong>Nils Kvam</strong> was a record producer who also worked with listening tests
and also provided opportunities for the company sales wise. He is still working with EC.</p>

<p><strong>Øystein Klevhus</strong> helped me with the Engineering Highschool
(I was rarely present ....), and I got
him a part-time job at EC from early 78 (or late 77) until spring 79. We did the <a href="school_amplifier.htm">School Amplifier</a> together, spring 79.</p>

<p>Two of the people in the production who really stayed for a while was <strong>Knut Arne
Jacobsen</strong> and his girlfriend at the time <strong>Aud</strong>.&nbsp; There were
also a couple of girls who came from Tandberg in the production - their names were
.......................... and ..................&nbsp; These also stayed for quite a
while.</p>

<p>There were also some sales and managing people (<strong>Helge</strong> ....., <strong>Jan
Richter</strong> among others) involved from period to period. I'm working on
re-remembering their names. Any help from others is appreciated.</p>

<p>Others who did contribute was for example Svein Erik's brother, <strong>Bjørn Børja</strong>
from Seas AS, who designed a cute little moving coil amplifier which EC manufactured for
some time. &nbsp; </p>

<p>During 1979 the company moved, I started my way out, other people came in, and I don't
recall their names, sorry. However, the first era of the Otala- amplifier ended somewhere
1979-1980, and the new Electrocompaniet appeared. It moved to Skaarer where it is still
located.
