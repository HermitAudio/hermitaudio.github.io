<h1>Other Designs</h1>

<p>There were several EC designs made from 75 to 80, the first period.&nbsp; Several of
these never made it into production.&nbsp; </p>

<p>On the following pages details of these designs are given, as far as we have been able
to recover them.&nbsp; Some schematic details, some of the story behind and the reason for
their development, and some technical goodies and possible, a hint or two.</p>

<h4>The Regulated 25W Power amplifier</h4>

<p>One of the interesting designs were&nbsp; the &quot;<a href="Reg25W.htm">Regulated 25W</a>&quot;
amplifier.&nbsp; This amplifier had regulated power supplies for both the pre- and power
stages.&nbsp; IT made away with all the ripple, and provided high speed power to the
amplifier.&nbsp; It sounded good ! But, the heat .....</p>

<h4>The May 78 Preamplifier</h4>

<p>Another interesting case was the &quot;<a href="may_78_preamplifier.htm">May 78</a>&quot;
preamplifier.&nbsp; I don't remember why it was called the May 78 preamp.&nbsp; It was
designed in the period January to July 1978. At Electrocompaniet this preamp was named
&quot;Model II&quot;.&nbsp; </p>

<h4>The School Amplifier</h4>

<p>The <a href="school_amplifier.htm">School Amplifier</a> as we called it, is not really
an EC design.&nbsp; I took an engineering degree at that time, in parallell with my work
at EC, and together with a friend, Øystein Klevhus, at that school, we did a project - of
course a power amplifier design.&nbsp; It was not intended for production at all, but it
was sponsored by EC, as all components, instruments etc. were EC stuff. </p>

<h4>The &quot;Krinken&quot; Preamplifier</h4>

<p>In 1977 we were approached by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, or in Norwegian -
Norsk Riks Kringkastning (NRK) and asked if we could develope a professional preamplifier
for studio work. It should have differential input and output. Of course, to us this
meant, no transformers. The electronics were completely differential all through.
&nbsp; The preamp had passive equalization, a lot of transistors, and sounded VERY good.
&nbsp; We will try to locate the schematics and put them up here.</p>
