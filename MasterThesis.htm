<p>University of Oslo, 1985</p>
<p>I will upload my master thesis when I've managed to convert it, preferably to
English, and at least from printed form. It was written on a long-forgotten
computer and I'm no longer able to convert the diskettes.</p>
<p>Preceding my master thesis I presented two papers at AES conventions early
in the eighties.&nbsp; One of these made it to the Journal of the AES.&nbsp;
I've scanned it, so take a look, it's about class AB distortion in power
amplifiers.&nbsp; This <a href="ABDist.htm"> article</a> was also used by the Danish High Fidelity
magazine, which made a follow-up article on it, and also presented an amplifier
modifications (of their own) based on this article. I've not been able to locate
this article, but I believe it was in 1983, possibly the October issue.&nbsp; If
anyone got it, I would appreciate a copy :-)</p>
