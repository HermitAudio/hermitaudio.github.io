<h1>The School Amplifier</h1>

<p>Øystein Klevhus, now at Telecast Norway AS, and myself, did a project together at the
end of our engineering school.&nbsp; I am greatly in debt to Øystein, because he was the
one who made it possible for me to go through with that school. I was far to occupied with
EC, and had far too little time for school. Øystein came to me at EC with school tasks
and other stuff I had to do, and in that way it was possible for me to take that school
without nearly being present.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The amplifier :&nbsp; It was a very special design, fully complementary, and used
matched single field-effect transistors at the input, and some very interesting output
transistors, with a very low turnover point.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I will come back later with more info on the matching of the input transistors. &nbsp;
Note also, the very low emitter resistors on the output stage.&nbsp; This matches a later
paper I did on the AES.&nbsp; More on this also later.
