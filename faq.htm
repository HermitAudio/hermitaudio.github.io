<p><font size="5" face="Arial Black">Q:</font><font size="1" face="Arial Black"> Why does
the Electrocompaniet amplifiers sound like the best combination of transistors and tubes ?</font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial Black">A:</font><font face="Garamond">Because they are
transistor amplifiers designed like a tube amplifier ! The inherent high gain of the
transistors is reduced in all stages to a level comparable to tube amplifiers. Using local
feedback does this, and in this process linearisation far beyond what is possible with
tubes is achieved. The whole thing is neatly packed together with a small but still
efficient level of external loop feedback, thus making the amplifier work like a single
stage of amplification, and not as N stages cascaded after each other!</font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial Black">Q:</font><font size="1" face="Arial Black">How are
they designed, and are there several different designs ?</font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial Black">A:</font><font face="Garamond">All Electrocompaniet
amplifiers are based on the same fundamental theory. Today's amplifiers are different from
the early designs, but only in implementation, not in how they conform to the theoretical
work upon which they are based. The amplifiers are very pure in their design, no
electronic tricks are employed. All parameters are carefully balanced against each other.
None of the transistors are squeezed beyond their capacity. Careful listening tests
combined with constant critique of design rules and measurement results bring the designs
forward.</font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial Black">Q:</font><font size="1" face="Arial Black">Does
loudspeaker cables really affect sound quality? And why ?</font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial Black">A:</font><font face="Garamond">Five years ago I did
not believe this. There seemed to be no natural explanation for this. However, together
with a good friend, Paal Rasmussen, we designed a loudspeaker cable, mostly for fun We
used every available technique, every method we could think of and tried to eliminate all
kinds of believed &quot;illnesses&quot;. The cable was very expensive, extremely stiff
(not surprisingly - the isolation was more like a solid plastic). All this to
&quot;prove&quot; we would not hear any difference. Guess what! We heard a very distinct
difference! We measured the cable and noted it was far better damped than any other cable
we measured. With a characteristic impedance of only 30 ohm, compared to around 80 for the
best of the others. It also had a higher resonance frequency, nearly 13 MHz compared to
around 5MHz for the others. Could this be any explanation - well, in fact. We only have
theories. The one which seems to fit best is the radio frequency interference (RFI)
theory. RFI can be a real killer for an amplifier, causing a lot of inband audio noise
modulated onto the audio signal. We call this modulation noise, and it is not easy to
measure. In radio equipment you'll pay some 50-100 k$ for this kind of equipment. And they
are not designed to measure in the audio frequency range :-(.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">If you want try a set of these cables, try to contact Paal, I
think he still has some left for sale. </font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial Black">Q:</font><font size="1" face="Arial Black">Is a class
A amplifier better than a class AB ?</font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial Black">A:</font><font face="Garamond">Yes and No. A class A
amplifier uses a higher quiescent current than a class AB. However, all amplifiers will at
a given load and signal level turn over to class AB. The problem with many Class A designs
is they runs the transistors at a higher current than where they are comfortable. This is
a often overlooked fact in audio amplifier design. See my upcoming article &quot;Class AB
power amplifier design&quot;. In order to design a good class A amplifier you will have to
use many transistors in parallel. The optimum current of nearly all good transistors stop
at below 1A. </font>
