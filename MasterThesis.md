###University of Oslo, 1985###
I will upload my master thesis when I've managed to convert it, preferably to 
English, and at least from printed form. It was written on a long-forgotten 
computer and I'm no longer able to convert the diskettes.
Preceding my master thesis I presented two papers at AES conventions early 
in the eighties.&nbsp; One of these made it to the Journal of the AES.
I've scanned it, so take a look, it's about class AB distortion in power
amplifiers.&nbsp;   This [article](ABDist.md) was also used by the Danish High Fidelity magazine, which made a follow-up article on it, and also presented an amplifier modifications (of their own) based on this article. I've not been able to locate this article, but I believe it was in 1983, possibly the October issue.  If anyone got it, I would appreciate a copy :-)
