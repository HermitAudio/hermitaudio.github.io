<p align="left">This page is intended to help you if you're going to service your
amplifier.&nbsp; Electrocompaniet still services their old amplifiers, and I still service
those I modified from 1979 to 1983, however, the process may be slow (too much other
things to do) so if you're good with a soldering iron and have some instruments to help
you along, this page together with the schematics may be what you need.</p>

<p align="left">The transformers were also special</p>

<p align="left">We thought we ought to have those exploded mechanical assembly view
drawings like the japaneese.&nbsp; What do you think about this ?</p>
