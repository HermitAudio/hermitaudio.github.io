title: Welcome to the Terje Sandstrom Audio Technology Web site!
---
For several years I worked on the design of audio equipment for very high fidelity use, primarily for Electrocompaniet.
As I no longer work actively in that field, I decided to put as much of what I know onto this site, and let everyone have a look.   
This site contains information on the audio technology I represent, on the history of the early Electrocompaniet period, from 1975 to 1980, and their world famous 25W "Otala" amplifier,
which I worked on.  The history information is endorsed by Electrocompaniet. 

I am still doing coaching and mentoring for [Electrocompaniet](http:///www.electrocompaniet.no) and will update with some information related to that over time.

The site also contains other information on audio related stuff, like my [M.Sc master thesis](MasterThesis.md) on weak non-linearities, audio theory and other stuff.

The pages here are in the process of being converted from my old site, which has been down for a few years, and some may still be in their old html form.

 My current work is within software development, the following links points to my other sites:
