<h4><big>Calculations on the 25W amp</big></h4>

<p>The following image is the first of an analysis done on the 25W amplifier.&nbsp; The
date, 4.July 1980 indicates that this was done after I left EC (which was in 79, at least
on a full time basis.&nbsp; After a short break 80 or something, I returned on a
consultancy basis to do some more for them until some time in 1982.)</p>

<p>I will upload the whole analysis.&nbsp; For those technically inclined it should be
interesting.&nbsp; Lots of similar analysis were also done earlier. I got the feeling that
many people believed we were only some kind of non-serious hippies or something. &nbsp;
Well, in a way we were outside the establishment, but we did our mathematics !&nbsp; Also
note the point made at the end of the note, saying that feedback below 20 db is no good
idea, when it comes to distortion. </p>
