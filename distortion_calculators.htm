<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="5">The Calculators</font></b></p>
<p>I've made a series of distortion calculators. The forst one is for a single
transistor stage, the next ones will be for differential stages and for multiple
stages. Over some time, I'll also upload calculators for other types of &quot;distortion&quot;,
like frequency response, noise, time-resposne and so on.&nbsp; They will all be
based on the types of amplifiers presented on these pages, and the theory that
accompanies them.&nbsp; The calculators will be made as ActiveX controls.&nbsp;
Please inform me if you have problems getting them to work. </p>
