# The People Involved

Several people were involved in the development of the 25 W amplifier. This chapter
take the history seen from the perspective of the people involved, in chronological order.

A Finnish Professor named **<a href="http://www.tut.fi/~strategy/otala/">Matti Otala</a>
(also <a href="http://www.otala.com">here</a>)**. On sabbatical at Phillips in
Eindhoven. Together with **Jan Lohstroh** they designed a TIM-free amplifier. It was one step in Otala's quest
against the new distortion called TIM, and
later DIM. 

**Svein Erik Børja**, a Norwegian broadcast and record producer
heard the presentation given by Dr Matti Otala at an AES conference in Copenhagen 1973.
 Together with **Nils Jørgen Kjærnet** at Nera he built two units
based on Otala/Lohstroh schematics. 

**Per Abrahamsen** was contacted by Svein Erik, who knew him from his Mojo
Blues times, and also knew that Per had an audio/electronics company. Mostly Per was
working with PA equipment, but the coming of the Otala amp turned his company
Electrocompaniet into an audio company.

At this time several others were involved with the company, but I don't remember all of
them, mostly because they were before my time, and also because they slowly disappeared as
the company changed from a PA company to a an audio company. Among these were **Petter Hjerpseth** and **Klaus Væthe Jr.** The latter later became a
good friend of mine, and we did try to make an audio company together in 1983, with the
help of <b>Paal Rasmussen</b>, my former partner at <a href="norsk_radiofabrikk.htm">NRF,</a>more later. 
Petter disappeared during 1975, Klaus stuck with
the company to and from until sometime in 1977/78.

I (**Terje Sandstrøm**) turned up first late 1974, and started to
visit EC at a monthly basis. After half a year of this Per told me we were both
better off if I started to work for him, instead of just spending his time. In the
beginning I mostly did assembly work, but during 1975 I had worked myself up the ladder,and later I did more and more of the theoretical work on the amplifier, calculations and so forth. I stayed until 1979, but did some part time work and consulting for EC until 1982.

It is important to note that Svein Erik stayed with the company as its Golden Ear for a very long time. In a way this was his hobby !

**Peik Borud** entered the company in 1976. He was a M.Sc. engineer in
electronics, and an audio freak. He stayed throughout 1978, and was together with
Per and me the basic designers of the 25W amplifier in this period. Peik did A LOT during his time at EC. 

**Paal Rasmussen** entered the company in 1977 and stayed on and off for slightly
less than a year.  He came from Seas AS, a loudspeaker company, and before that he had worked in England with several of the famous designers there.  He and I were two out of the three who started The Norwegian Radio
Manufacturing company in 1979, more on this later.

**Kjell Winther** was our record provider, and got amplifiers in
return. He was also a hi-fi nut, working in a record store, and provided us with the
latest and best sounding records for our sound tests.

**Nils Kvam** was a record producer who also worked with listening tests
and also provided opportunities for the company sales wise. He is still working with EC.

**Øistein Klevhus** helped me with the Engineering Highschool
(I was rarely present ....), and I got
him a part-time job at EC from early 78 (or late 77) until spring 79. We did the  [School Amplifier](schoolamplifier.md) together, spring 79.

Two of the people in the production who really stayed for a while was **Knut Arne
Jacobsen** and his girlfriend at the time **Aud**. There were
also a couple of girls who came from Tandberg in the production - their names were
.......................... and .................. These also stayed for quite a
while.

There were also some sales and managing people (**Helge** ....., **Jan
Richter** among others) involved from period to period. I'm working on
re-remembering their names. Any help from others is appreciated.

Others who did contribute was for example Svein Erik's brother, **Bjørn Børja**
from Seas AS, who designed a cute little moving coil amplifier which EC manufactured for
some time.  

During 1979 the company moved, I started my way out, other people came in, and I don't
recall their names, sorry. However, the first era of the Otala- amplifier ended somewhere
1979-1980, and the new Electrocompaniet appeared. It moved to Skaarer where it is still
located.
