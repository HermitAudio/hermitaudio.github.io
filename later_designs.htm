<h4><a name="Preamplifier of 1982"><strong><big>Preamplifier of 1982</big></strong></a></h4>

<p>This preamplifier was designed in 1982, and a prototype made in 1983.&nbsp; Only one
unit exist, and it sounds wonderful.&nbsp; This is by far the best sounding preamplifier I
ever have made.&nbsp; Still today I'm rather pleased with the design. It is divided into
several Gain Blocks. In the <a href="schematics_2.htm">schematics section</a> accompanying
this I've shown the block schematics and one of the gain stages, which is used two places.
&nbsp; I will place more details on this design later.</p>

<p>This design was also made in one prototype, but it never made it into a fully working
version, althught it worked partly. The design was rather good anyway, and had a lot of
interesting features. The <a href="cooling_fins.htm">cooling fins</a>, for example, used
new heat transfer knowledge to its best. I have never seen similars either before or
after.&nbsp; </p>
