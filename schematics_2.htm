<p>This is the Phone Stage, handling both MM (Moving Magnet) and MC (Moving Coil) pickups.
&nbsp; The design uses active RIAA compensation.&nbsp; This is untraditional for the EC
design which up to this time used passive high-pass and active low-boost. The gain stages
are design to handle the active feedback, and note <big><strong>(!!!!!)</strong></big>,
the active RIAA compensation used <u>SHUNT FEEDBACK</u>.&nbsp; A tough job to calculate
but when that was done, it worked wonders !</p>

<p>The line stage section is more traditional, with a normal series feedback line stage.
Note the extra buffer on the output.</p>

<p>For both block schematics above, note the roman numbers inside the amplifiers, denoting
the particular gain block used.</p>

<p>This drawing show the gain block 3 and 4. Note the completely symmetrical design.
&nbsp; The other gain stages also used an ingenious method of utilizing&nbsp; all the
current from the last differential stage.&nbsp; Also note the current generators, ever
seen something like that ;-) - well - it works ! Check back for more later! </p>

<p>(<small><strong>Also: Details on compensations and other stuff will be described. Don't
try to build the gain stage as described above - smoke will arise. Be patient.</strong></small>
