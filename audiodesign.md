title: Audio Design

I have collected all the other audio design stuff, miscellanous bits and pieces here. 

The [School Amplifier](schoolamplifier) is the first one out, made together with Oistein Klevhus when we were at Oslo Engineering High School, 1979.

The [ultimate cooling fins](cooling_fins) is also a good one.  

Also see my [AES paper on AB Distortion](abdist)
