		<h1>The modified amplifiers</h1>
		<p>After I left Electrocompaniet in 1979, I tried to start up a new audio company 
			in Asker together with two good friends, Paal Rasmussen and Espen 
			Evensberget.&nbsp; We called the company "Norsk Radio Fabrikk" (in english - 
			Norwegian Radio Manufacturing company".&nbsp; We wanted it to sound 
			old-fashioned, and really had a lot of good fun with this.&nbsp; However, our 
			own designs, which will be shown here, never made it into reality. In 1980, or 
			thereabout, we started to modify EC amplifiers.&nbsp; We modified between 50 
			and 100 amplifiers, and a somewhat lesser number of preamplifiers.&nbsp; The 
			sound improvement was very good - not too suprising, since I knew these 
			amplifiers in and out.&nbsp; Later we did some 50 amplifiers from the bottom 
			up, called Special Version, the modification taken to the end.&nbsp; The 
			components for these amplfiiers came partially from Electrocompaniet. I don't 
			think Per liked it, but I also don't think he really bothered. If he had, he 
			wouldn't have sold us components - like cabinets and so on.</p>
		<p>
		I have had some trouble locating all the schematics and component lists - don't 
		really know where I have (mis)placed them.&nbsp;
		<p>However, I have redrawn the <a href="modified_schem.htm">schematics</a>
		for the modified amplifier.
		<P>I've also included some <A href="mod_pics.htm">pictures</A>
		of the modified circuits, so that you can see for yourself how we did the 
		practical part of the modifications.&nbsp; Note that none of the lanes were cut 
		on the circuit board.&nbsp; All new components were wire-mounted 
		("birds-nests") - not the prettiest thing, but it sure works.&nbsp;
		<P>
		Note that in the modified schematic the blue components are new, the red are 
		changed, the rest is as in the original.&nbsp;
		<P>
		The modification significantly reduces the distortion of the amplifier, thus 
		brings much more clarity to the midrange, also a tighter bass, and a smoother - 
		less harsh top.
		<P>
		&nbsp;
		<P>(Also, this <A href="a_strange_one.htm">schematic</A> popped up - I think it is 
			a later version, which also never made it into reality. &nbsp; The component 
			values, and general setup is equal to the modified ones, thought. &nbsp; The 
			difference seems to be an extra double pair of output transistors, and the 
			emitterfollowers before the third stage. )
