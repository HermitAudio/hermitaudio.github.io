<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial Black">Introduction -The birth of the Otala amplifier</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">On an AES conference in 1973, <a href="http://www.tut.fi/~strategy/otala/"> Dr. Matti Otala</a> presented a paper
describing the design of a TIM-free audio amplifier. Present at this conference 
was Svein
Erik Børja, a Norwegian record and broadcasting producer, and a great audio enthusiast.
Svein Erik Børja also was one of this times greatest Golden Ears. He was able to hear
even the slightest imperfection in an audio component. Having been dissatisfied with the
sound of that days transistorised audio amplifiers, he here saw an opportunity for getting
an audio amplifier of a new generation. The talk of Dr. Otala about TIM also was an
explanation to Svein Erik for the imperfections he himself had noted in audio amplifiers. </font>
</span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">He brought the paper to a friend of him who was&nbsp; running his own audio company in Norway, Per Abrahamsen of Electrocompaniet. Per decided
to make a try at the amplifier to see what it might bring. They got the help of Nils
Jørgen Kjærnet at Nera in Oslo, who made circuit boards design and also, to my
knowledge, helped in the mechanical design of the amplifier.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">They first made just a couple of amplifiers, but the sound was so
good, fulfilling all their expectations, they decided to manufacture a series of these
amplifiers.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">I started showing up at Electrocompaniet in the autumn 74, and
started to work for Per in the spring of 75. One of my first jobs was to assemble the
first production series of the Otala amplifiers. It was a series of 10 amplifiers, based
on the same PCB's as the original two prototypes.&nbsp; During the summer I started to
look at the design, having been an electronics hobbyist since early teenage. At that time
neither Per nor myself knew too much about high-end audio design. It may well have been
the factor that brought forth the success of the amplifier, as it evolved during the next
5 years. We didn't know how it should be done, so we did it out from the framework given
by the Otala amplifier. We may well have been the first audio amplifier designers in the
new school - the TIM free designers, so to speak.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial Black">The first Otala amplifier in &quot;production&quot;</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">The first amplifier series was using the same printed circuit
boards as was used on the first two prototypes. The PCB was a two-layer design, we called
it a T-board, due its shape. The power transistors were mounted onto the cooling fin from
both sides of the stem of the 'T'. One layer of the board was a ground plane (Nera being a
RF-company, it was not so strange.) The ground plane caused us a lot of mounting problems,
because the component legs often got stripped when they were squeezed through the holes in
the PCB, causing small metal pieces from the legs to curl up and making sweet, nearly
invisible, shorts to the ground plane. We did see smoke....</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">In the autumn 75 we started to get some attention, and a visit to
Matti Otala at the VTT (Valtionen Teknilinnen Tutmiskeskus - Technical Research Center of
Finland ) where he worked as a professor was needed.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">There were several reasons:</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">We had named the amplifier &quot;Otala - Lohstroh&quot; after its
inventors, and Otala wanted to see the amplifier before he and Lohstroh possibly could
allow us to use his name. </font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">At the same time, we started to experience problems with the
amplifier - it didn't quite have the specifications stated in the AES paper. We needed his
help.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">As it turned out, the amplifier was renamed to &quot;The 2
channel audio power amplifier&quot;, which was the name used for the rest of the
amplifiers lifetime.&nbsp; The relationship with Otala was established, and he visited the
company on several occasions.&nbsp; There is still a good contact between Otala and
Electrocompaniet.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial Black">Period of confusion, start of revision</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">It was early 1976. We started to invest in measuring equipment.
The company turned slowly into a audio amplifier company. The company lost several of its
old customers, the loudspeakers that the company were selling was more neglected. We
worked from early morning into the late nights. That should be the standard for the coming
4 years. <a name="AmplifierBlowUp"></a>An amplifier brought to the US by Svein Erik blew
up, at the first listening test - embarrassing. We used the night to invent a new type of <a href="protection_networks.htm">short circuit protection</a>. We didn't want anything that
could affect the sound, so we simply used a high impedance circuit to sense the current
through the output transistors, and then used a relay to switch of the voltage to the
output transistors. It worked!</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">We now understood that we had to start changing the amplifier.
Svein Erik's golden ears got even more important than they had ever been before. We were
on uncharted territory, the old measurement methods could not be trusted. We had to rely
on our own methods, our own interpretations of the measurement results. Now started an
active period with theory, practice, reading articles (Svein Erik provided us with
articles 'en masse', on all aspects of audio design, and electronics design in general.) </font>
</span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">We found that the compensation scheme used in the amplifier did
not work correctly. As we measured the bandwidth to be far less than what was specified,
we needed to redesign these filters. The amplifier used shunt-feedback, one of its really
strong points, with an input lag compensation. At each amplifying stage, there was three,
a lead-lag compensation was introduced. These did not match the actual pole's we measured.
One of the reasons for this, we assumed was that the original design was using
&quot;fresh&quot; newly developed Phillips transistors. As both Otala and Lohstroh were
working at the Eindhoven Phillips lab's at the time of the design we assumed they could
have access to better transistors. (I don't remember if Otala ever confirmed this to be
case.)</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">In any case, a period started where we changed the compensation
back and forth with no or little effect. We did achieve something, but not any significant
improvement.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">We had also now measured the distortion (having just bought our
first distortion measurement set and spectrum analyzer). It was not nice, the
distortion was far worse than specified, and far below even our expectations. Again we
didn't manage to do anything significant at first.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">A major change happened first when we started to change the
quiescent current of the transistors. The design was in fact done as a mix between the old
way and the new way. Older design books learn that you should use low current in the first
stage do to noise. This was also done here, but (see &quot;Noise optimisation&quot;) for
an explanation of why this is not the case). We knew this theory to be in error, and
increased the quiescent currents, thus decreasing the resistance and again increasing
dramatically the bandwidth of the amplifier. The distortion also went down, not
dramatically but enough to make a significant change in the sound to the better (see
&quot;Transistors, resistors, current and distortion&quot; [coming]).</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial Black">The Audio Critic</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">At this time we started to hear rumours about a <a href="audio_critic_test.htm">test</a> in the US on our amplifier. One day our mail started
to overflow, and a few days later we got hold of the test ourselves. It was in a magazine
named The Audio Critic and the test was fabulous. It started &quot;</font><font size="4" face="Garamond" color="#FF0000">Audio freaks - Eat your hearts out: This is the worlds
best sounding amplifier, and One: You can't buy one in this country </font><font face="Garamond">(The USA!), and Two: (not surprisingly - the only slightly negative in the
whole test) It is too low powered to be counted. &quot; Suddenly we had more requests for
amplifiers than we could hope to handle. Sales boomed. It was mid 76.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">We worked all summer, mornings - days - evenings - and into the
night. Monday to Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Per's wife, Anne, was not always too happy
about this. Per had two small boys, and she had to take care of them a lot by herself.
Anyway - her &quot;sacrifice&quot; made the makings of these amplifiers possible, and a
good thing about it all is that both Per's and Anne's sons are now working at
Electrocompaniet ! So at last it turned out to be an investment into their future as well
!</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><a name="TheGreatChange"></a><font face="Arial Black">The great change</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">Dr. Otala's theorems on TIM very often came out as an attack on
high-feedback amplifiers. Although it is correct that high-feedback amplifiers are more
prone to TIM than low-feedback amplifier, there is no magic here. The main goal of any
amplifier is to reproduce the incoming music as perfectly as possible, not adding nor
subtracting anything. TIM is just one type of distortion, it will not help to exchange one
type with another. It is true that some types of distortion are harsher to the ear than
others, but there still is a balance to be done. If 0.1% of TIM equals 1% of THD in
audibility, then an amplifier with 2% THD and 0.07% TIM will sound worse than an amplifier
with 1% THD and 0.1% TIM. </font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">So, we realised than the balance of distortions were the
essential factor to consider. Not only do you have to balance THD against TIM, but also
low frequency distortion against high frequency distortion, frequency and phase response
against non-linear distortion in general, and so on.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">This insight triggered the Great Change: </font>
</span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">One night (it always happened at night times!) we increased the
feedback 10dB, to a total amount of 30dB feedback. The sound improvement was staggering!!!
And, contrary to common belief in our own community !&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">After this we only adjusted the amplifier slightly. It had found
the form it should have for its remaining life at Electrocompaniet. And, the amplifier was
a success! </font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial Black">On Marketing</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Garamond">We did brochures !&nbsp; The first one is seen <a href="our_first_brochure.htm">here</a>.&nbsp; Second one is <a href="our_second_brochure.htm">here</a>..</font> 
</span><font face="Garamond">The rest of the marketing was done by
ear-to-ear rumours. The fact that the amplifier and the company was sort of hard to get
stimulated the market.&nbsp; Here was a mysterious company with a killer amplifier. Audio
people love such stuff ! </font> </p>
