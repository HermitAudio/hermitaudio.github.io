<p>Note the handdrawing on the schematic.&nbsp; First attempts on traditional current
limiting can be seen.&nbsp; This was soon discarded. Note also the extra resistors near
the output.&nbsp; The loudspeaker was to be coupled between the output terminal and the
small 0.1 ohm resistor to ground.&nbsp; This was a later idea (don't remember when it was
introduced) which would give some current feedback in addition to the traditional voltage
feedback.&nbsp; The effect would be to make the loudspeak &quot;invisible&quot; to the
amplifier.&nbsp; I will come back later to this - &lt;here&gt;.</p>

<p>Note that you can see the prices on the transistors here, NOK 4.70 in qty 100 for
BD203/204. Cheap transistors !</p>
