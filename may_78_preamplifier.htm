<h1>The May 78 Preamplifier</h1>

<p>I will over some time show all details available on this preamplifier.&nbsp; First, the
line stage. The specifications achieved is shown below:</p>

<p>The design was made very similar to the &quot;Otala&quot; designs.&nbsp; It was a
single power supply design, note the input and output capacitors. It was designed to
replace our old completely single-ended preamplifier, which was never a big hit.
